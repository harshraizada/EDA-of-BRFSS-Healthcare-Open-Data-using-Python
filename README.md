# EDA-of-BRFSS-Healthcare-Open-Data-using-Python

## Brief Summary on the Topic:

My interest in Healthcare forced me to select the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) open data set, which is the United states premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect data about U.S. residents (18 year or older) regarding their health-related risk behaviours, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.
The BRFSS Questionnaire: Each year, the states—represented by their BRFSS coordinators and CDC—agree on the content of the questionnaire. The BRFSS questionnaire consists of three sections 
1.Core component
2.Optional modules, and 
3.State-added questions.

What is risk factor surveillance?
Keeping track of the rates of risk factors which are the things or states in our daily lives that confers risk to our health is defined as a Risk Factor Surveillance.
By collecting behavioural health risk data at the federal and state level, BRFSS has become a powerful tool for targeting and designing health promotion activities for the US population.

## Description of analysis procedure and objectives:

 I have tried to done Descriptive analytics which usually aims at developing population based rates (or percentage) with this data set.
Originally BRFSS data set were having sample of 486303 US residents (observations) and 275 variables in the data set but I have taken only those observations into consideration who have completed the interview and done slicing after which I have left with 421192 observation with 275 variables (which were required for my  analysis).

Objective-1 To find out the existing coverage rate of Tetanus shot among US residents. 

Objective-2 To find out the existing coverage rate of  Pneumococcal vaccine among US residents.

Objective-3 To find out how much percentage of US residents ever told about asthma by their doctor.

Objective-4 Among those who ever told about asthma by doctor how many still have asthma? 

Objective-5 Among those who still have asthma how many had an episode of asthma or an asthma attack in past 12 months? 

Objective -6 To find out the existing  Breasts cancer screening rate among US residents.

Objective-7 To find out the existing  Cervical cancer screening rate among US residents.

Object-8 To find out the existing HIV testing rate among US residents.
